Based on the dataset you've collected and the assignment requirements, here's a suggested approach to satisfy the requirements:

Problem Statement:
You could focus on predicting team performance or analyzing factors that contribute to a team's success in Euro 2024. For example, "Predicting team performance in Euro 2024 based on various in-game statistics."
Data Preprocessing:


Check for missing values and handle them appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal).
Look for outliers and decide how to treat them.
Normalize or standardize numerical features if needed.
Consider feature engineering (e.g., creating new features like goal difference or win ratio).


Implement at least five machine learning / deep learning algorithms:
You could use the following algorithms:

a) Linear Regression: To predict total goals or matches won.
b) Logistic Regression: To classify teams into high/low performers.
c) Random Forest: For both classification and regression tasks.
d) Support Vector Machine (SVM): For classification.
e) Neural Network: A simple multi-layer perceptron for prediction or classification.
If you want to explore more advanced options:
f) Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM)
g) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Metrics for evaluation:
Depending on whether you frame this as a regression or classification problem, you can use:

For regression:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R-squared (RÂ²)
Adjusted R-squared

For classification:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
ROC-AUC


Compare performance:
Create a table or graph comparing the performance of all algorithms across the chosen metrics.
Analysis and Insights:


Discuss which features are most important for predicting team performance.
Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in this context.
Provide insights into what factors contribute most to a team's success.


Novel/Hybrid Approach:
Consider an ensemble method combining multiple algorithms, or a two-stage approach where you use one algorithm to select features and another to make predictions.
